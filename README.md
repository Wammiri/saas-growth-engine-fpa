# SaaS Growth Engine: Revenue Forecasting & Churn Optimization Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes financial data from 500 SaaS companies to forecast revenue growth, benchmark churn, and simulate profitability scenarios.  
The goal is to show how FP&A teams can optimize SaaS growth by improving churn rates, pricing strategies, and LTV:CAC ratios.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [SaaS Financial Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishqpratap/saas-financial-market-dataset)
- Metrics include: MRR, ARR, churn rate, CAC, LTV, employee count, funding, and revenue history.

## Features (Planned)
1. **Data Cleaning & Metrics**  
   - ARR, LTV, LTV:CAC ratios  
   - Growth rate calculations  

2. **Exploratory Analysis & Benchmarking**  
   - Churn by company size  
   - ARR growth distribution  
   - LTV:CAC quartiles  

3. **Forecasting & Scenario Analysis**  
   - ARR and churn forecasting with Prophet  
   - What-if scenarios (pricing, churn reduction, CAC changes)  
   - Monte Carlo simulations  

4. **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**  
   - ARR projections  
   - Churn benchmarks  
   - Scenario sliders  

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, prophet, plotly, matplotlib)
- Streamlit for dashboard
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run (coming soon)
Instructions will be added once the notebook and Streamlit app are complete.
